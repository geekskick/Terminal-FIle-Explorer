A simple file exploring system

Controls include:
	Go up a level
	Go to top level
	Exit

Allows the user to quickly explore the files on their computer from the command line without using cd, ls etc.

Unable to change the working directory of the terminal from this program on exit however. If someone wants to tell me?
